        <p>Majorville is located on Lake Michigan where Pine Creek empties into Lake Michigan just south of Esky Road.  Today this is one of the most popular swimming beaches in the Lakeshore, but in the 1870s and 1880s, Majorville was a booming lumber town!</p>
         <br>
        <p> Following the U. S. Civil War, the veterans returned home, and John Major settled with his wife Julia and daughter Anna in Northern Michigan. He began buying land in Platte and Lake townships as investments. Lumber speculators soon arrived looking for stands of white pine. Most of the forest in this area was hardwood, but there were some stands of white pine</p>
